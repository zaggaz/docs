An outreach sequence is a webhook-triggered, multi-channel workflow. When your external system sends a POST request to the webhook URL, Unibound runs a sequence of steps — calls, SMS, emails, or WhatsApp messages — to engage the lead.

## How It Works

Each outreach sequence has its own unique webhook URL with an authentication token. When you create a sequence, Unibound generates the URL automatically. You copy it and integrate it into your CRM, form handler, or any system that can send HTTP POST requests.

## POST Body

When triggering the webhook, send a JSON body with the lead's details. The available fields are:

```json title="Request body"
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "number": "+1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "context": "Lead expressed interest via website form",
  "customProperties": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "source": "Website Demo",
    "productInterest": "Enterprise Plan"
  }
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | The lead's full name |
| `number` | Conditional | Phone number in E.164 format. Required if the sequence includes Call, SMS, or WhatsApp steps. |
| `email` | Conditional | Email address. Required if the sequence includes Email steps. |
| `context` | No | Free-text context passed to the AI agent. The agent uses this to personalize the conversation. |
| `customProperties` | No | An object of key-value pairs. These become template variables you can use when writing copy in sequence steps — e.g. `{firstName}`, `{company}`. |

<Tip>
**Template variables:** Use `{name}`, `{email}`, or any key from `customProperties` in your SMS/email templates. For example, if you send `"customProperties": { "firstName": "John" }`, you can write `Hi {firstName}` in your message template.
</Tip>

## Sequence Setup

Before defining steps, you need to configure the sequence's resources — these determine which channels are available:

- **Label** — A descriptive name for the sequence (e.g. "Lead Follow-up", "Sales Outreach")
- **Phone Number** — Enables Call, SMS, and WhatsApp steps. Outbound sequences can share phone numbers; only inbound call channels require exclusive numbers.
- **Email Account** — Enables Email steps. Connect a Gmail account to use it for outbound emails.
- **Agent** — Select the agent that will handle conversations triggered by this sequence.

## Sequence Steps

Each step defines a channel, a delay, and optional content. Steps execute in order — if the lead engages (picks up a call, replies to a message) the sequence stops for that channel.

### Channel Types

#### Call

Places an outbound call to the lead. You can optionally set a custom **Opening Line** for the call step — e.g. `Hi {name}, I'm calling from {company}...`. If left empty, the agent uses its default greeting.

#### SMS

Sends an SMS message. You can choose between:

- **AI Generated** (default) — The AI composes the message based on context and the lead's data
- **Manual Template** — Write your own message using template variables like `{name}` or `{firstName}`

#### Email

Sends an email from the connected account. Options include:

- **AI Generated** (default) — The AI writes the email body based on context
- **Manual Template** — Write your own subject and body using template variables
- **Reply to Previous** — If there's an earlier email step in the sequence, you can send this as a reply on the same thread instead of a new email
- **Subject** — Set a subject line, or leave empty for AI to generate one (not needed when replying)

#### WhatsApp

Sends a WhatsApp message using the WhatsApp Business API. WhatsApp outbound messages require pre-approved templates from Twilio's Content API. Select a template and fill in the variable values — variables can use the same `{variable}` syntax.

### Step Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Channel** | Call, SMS, Email, or WhatsApp — availability depends on your configured resources |
| **Delay** | Time to wait before executing this step (minutes or hours). The first step can also have a delay. |
| **Run Regardless** | Available on steps after the first. When enabled, this step executes even if a previous call connected or the customer replied. Useful for confirmation emails after a successful call. |

<Info>
**Sequence behavior:** Steps run in order after their configured delay. If the lead picks up a call or replies to a message, the sequence pauses for that channel. Steps can be drag-and-dropped to reorder them.
</Info>

## Webhook URL & Testing

After saving, your webhook URL is displayed on the channel page. It includes the sequence ID and a unique authentication token. Copy the URL and integrate it into your external system.

You can test the webhook directly from the dashboard using the built-in test panel — enter a JSON body and send a test request to verify everything works before going live.

<Warning>
**Unique URLs:** Each outreach sequence has its own webhook URL with its own token. Creating another sequence generates a completely separate URL. You can regenerate the token at any time if needed.
</Warning>

## Activation

Toggle the connection to **Active** to start processing incoming webhook triggers. When deactivated, webhook requests will be rejected.

See [Webhook Events](/api-reference/webhook-events) for callback events and [Testing Webhooks](/api-reference/testing-webhooks) for detailed testing guidance.
