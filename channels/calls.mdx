Connect your AI agent to phone calls — both inbound and outbound. Each call channel requires a phone number assigned to the agent and an agent selected to handle the conversation.

## Inbound Calls

An inbound call channel lets your AI agent answer incoming phone calls automatically. When a lead calls your number, the agent picks up, greets the caller, qualifies them, and can book meetings or transfer the call.

### Setup

To create an inbound call channel:

- **Label** — Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g. "Inbound Sales", "Customer Support")
- **Phone Number** — Select a phone number from your configured numbers. Once activated, the phone number is locked to preserve conversation history.
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will handle incoming calls
- **Opening Line** — Define what the agent says when answering the call (e.g. "Hello! Thank you for calling. How can I help you today?")

<Warning>
**Opening line:** Keep your greeting concise — callers expect a response within 2–3 seconds. Long greetings can lead to hang-ups.
</Warning>

### Call Flow

- Agent answers with the configured opening line
- Conversation flows naturally based on the agent's configuration and knowledge base
- Qualification questions are woven into the conversation
- If qualified, agent offers to book a meeting or transfer the call
- Post-call actions trigger (CRM logging, notifications, etc.)

### Activation

Once you've configured all required fields, toggle the agent to **Live**. This sets up the inbound call routing so that calls to your number reach the AI agent. You can deactivate at any time.

## Outbound Calls

Outbound calls are initiated through an [Outreach Sequence](/channels/outreach-sequence). You create a webhook-triggered sequence and add a **Call** step to it. When the webhook is triggered with a lead's details, the agent calls the lead automatically.

### How It Works

- Create an [Outreach Sequence](/channels/outreach-sequence) channel
- Add a **Call** step to the sequence (optionally with a custom opening line)
- Trigger the sequence via the webhook endpoint with the lead's phone number
- The agent calls the lead using the phone number assigned to the sequence
- The conversation follows the same flow as inbound — qualification, booking, CRM logging

<Info>
**Caller ID:** Outbound calls use the phone number assigned to the outreach sequence as the caller ID. Make sure you've configured a number in the sequence's resources.

### Call Recording

All calls — inbound and outbound — are recorded and transcribed automatically. Recordings and transcripts are available in the conversation history for review and compliance.
