Connect a Gmail account to enable AI-powered email conversations. Your agent can receive and respond to incoming emails, with the same intelligence as voice and messaging channels.

## Setup

To create an email channel:

- **Label** — A descriptive name (e.g. "Inbound Sales Email Agent")
- **Email Account** — Connect a Gmail account via OAuth. Click "Connect Gmail" and authorize Unibound to send and receive emails on your behalf. Once activated, the email account is locked to preserve conversation history.
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will handle incoming emails

<Info>
**Email providers:** Gmail is fully supported. Outlook support is coming soon.

## Response Criteria

Control which emails your agent responds to:

- **Replies Only Mode** — When enabled, the agent only responds to emails that are replies to conversations you initiated (useful for outbound sequences)
- **Response Criteria** — Describe which emails the agent should respond to (e.g. "Only respond to product inquiries, pricing, or demo requests. Ignore newsletters and automated notifications."). Leave empty to respond to all business-related emails.

## Email Threads

Your agent maintains context across entire email threads. It reads the full conversation history before composing a reply, ensuring coherent and contextually relevant responses.

## Auto Follow-Up

Enable automatic email follow-ups if the lead doesn't respond. Configure a sequence of delays (in hours or days) — the agent sends follow-up emails at each interval. Follow-ups are sent on the same thread.

## Outbound Email

For outbound email campaigns, use an [Outreach Sequence](/channels/outreach-sequence) with Email steps. You can write manual templates with variables, let the AI generate the body, and chain multiple emails as replies on the same thread.
