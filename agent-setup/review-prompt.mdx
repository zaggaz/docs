The Review Prompt step gives you full control over the exact prompt sent to your AI agent. This is for power users who want to fine-tune exactly how the agent behaves, responds, and structures conversations.

## How It Works

When you create an agent, Unibound automatically generates a prompt based on your configuration — your [agent profile](/agent-setup/agent-profile), [knowledge base](/agent-setup/knowledge-base), [qualification questions](/agent-setup/qualification), and [booking](/agent-setup/booking) settings. The Review Prompt step lets you see and edit this generated prompt directly.

## Variables

The prompt uses variables that are replaced with actual values at runtime. You can insert these anywhere in the prompt:

- `{name}` — The agent's display name
- `{role}` — The agent's role/title
- `{companyName}` — Your company name
- `{tone}` — The conversation tone
- `{objective}` — The agent's main objective
- `{knowledgeBase}` — The full knowledge base content
- `{qualificationQuestions}` — Questions and branching logic

## Editing the Prompt

The editor shows your prompt alongside a live preview with variables replaced by their actual values. Invalid variables are highlighted in red so you can catch typos.

You can restructure sections, change the conversation flow, add custom instructions, or completely rewrite the prompt. The agent will follow whatever instructions are in the prompt.

```text title="Example prompt structure"
# Context
You are {name}, a {role}, working for {companyName}.

# Communication Style
- Maintain a {tone} tone throughout
- Keep responses short and concise
- Always ask 1 question at a time

# Your Objective
{objective}

# Qualification Questions
{qualificationQuestions}

# Knowledge Base
{knowledgeBase}
```

<Warning>
**Configuration changes:** If you modify settings in other steps (e.g., add a qualification question or change the agent name), your custom prompt won't automatically update. You'll see a warning and can choose to reset to the new default or keep your custom version.
</Warning>

## Resetting to Default

You can reset the prompt to the auto-generated default at any time. This will incorporate all your latest configuration changes. Note that resetting discards any custom edits.

## Best Practices

- Start with the default prompt and make incremental changes
- Use the preview pane to verify your prompt reads correctly with real values
- Keep a backup of your custom prompt before resetting
- Test changes in the built-in simulator before going live
- Use variables instead of hardcoding values so changes propagate automatically
