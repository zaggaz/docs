The knowledge base provides your AI agent with the context it needs to answer questions accurately. Your agent will **only** answer questions if it has the answer in the knowledge base or in the prompt itself — it won't make things up.

## Website Scraping

Enter your website URL and Unibound will automatically crawl your site and generate a knowledge base in plain text. The scraper follows internal links to extract content from your public pages, including product information, case studies, and proof points.

If the scraper can't access your site (e.g., due to bot protection), you'll be prompted to manually paste content from your website instead. The pasted content will be processed and added to the knowledge base in the same way.

<Info>
**How crawling works:** The scraper starts from the URL you provide and follows internal links to discover pages. Content is extracted, cleaned, and converted into plain text that the agent can reference. If scraping fails, a fallback option lets you copy-paste content from your site directly.

## Bring Your Own Knowledge Base

You can also write or paste your own knowledge base content directly. The knowledge base is a plain text field that you can edit however you'd like — add company information, product details, pricing, FAQs, objection handling scripts, competitive positioning, or anything else your agent should know.

## Editing the Knowledge Base

Whether auto-generated from a website or manually added, the knowledge base is fully editable. You can refine, restructure, add, or remove content at any time. The content is stored as plain text in a single editor.

## Best Practices

- Keep entries focused — one topic per section
- Include answers to the most common questions your leads ask
- Add objection handling scripts for sales agents
- Review and update content regularly to keep information current
- Include specific numbers, case studies, and proof points for credibility
