Enable your agent to book meetings directly into your calendar after qualifying a lead. Unibound integrates with two calendar providers: Google Calendar and HubSpot.

## Enabling Booking

Toggle booking on in the agent setup flow. Once enabled, your agent will offer to schedule a meeting when appropriate during the conversation — typically after qualification questions are complete.

## Google Calendar

Connect your Google account and select which calendar to use for booking. Configure:

- **Calendar** — Choose which Google Calendar to book into
- **Meeting duration** — 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes
- **Meeting title** — Customize the event title (use `{{name}}` to insert the lead's name)
- **Timezone** — The timezone for scheduling
- **Minimum lead time** — Set the minimum time into the future a meeting can be booked (in hours or days). This prevents the agent from booking meetings too soon — for example, setting 24 hours ensures the agent won't book a meeting for later today.

<Tip>
**Lead time:** Use minimum lead time to give yourself buffer before meetings. If you need time to prepare or review the lead before the call, set a lead time of 1-2 days.
</Tip>

## HubSpot Calendar

If you use HubSpot's meeting scheduler, connect your HubSpot account and select a meeting link. Meeting durations are pulled from your HubSpot configuration.

- **Calendar** — Select from your HubSpot meeting links
- **Meeting duration** — Determined by the selected HubSpot calendar
- **Timezone** — The timezone for scheduling

## How It Works

When booking is enabled, the agent checks real-time availability on the connected calendar and offers available time slots to the lead. Once a slot is confirmed, the meeting is created automatically with all relevant details.
