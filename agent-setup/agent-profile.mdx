Configure your AI agent's identity — who it is, how it sounds, and what it's trying to accomplish. This is the first step when creating a new agent.

## Agent Name

The name your agent introduces itself as during conversations (e.g., "Sarah", "Alex"). Choose a name that fits your brand and feels natural in conversation.

## Company Name

The company your agent represents. This is used in introductions and email signatures.

## Role

The professional role your agent takes on — for example, Sales Development Representative, Customer Success Manager, or Appointment Setter. This helps frame the agent's behavior and the way it communicates.

## Voice

Select a voice for your agent from a set of pre-built options. Voices include US and UK accents in both male and female options. For advanced use cases, you can also provide a custom ElevenLabs voice ID to use your own cloned or designed voice.

## Tone

Choose how your agent communicates. Options include **Professional**, **Friendly**, **Casual**, **Formal**, and **Enthusiastic**. The tone affects word choice, sentence structure, and overall conversational style.

<Tip>
**Best practice:** Match the tone to your target audience. B2B enterprise prospects typically respond better to a professional tone, while SMB and consumer audiences prefer friendly or casual.

## Objective

Define what your agent should accomplish in each conversation. This is a free-text field where you describe the agent's main goal — for example, "Qualify inbound leads and book meetings with our sales team" or "Answer customer questions and escalate complex issues."
