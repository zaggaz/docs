A walkthrough of the main sections of the Unibound dashboard and how to navigate them effectively.

## Agents Panel

The agents panel is your home base. Here you'll see all your AI agents listed with their status (active/paused), assigned channels, and recent activity. Click any agent to edit its configuration.

## Leads View

The leads view shows all contacts your agents have interacted with. Filter by status (qualified, unqualified, booked), search by name or phone number, and click into any lead to see the full conversation history.

## Conversations

View real-time and historical transcripts of all agent interactions. Each conversation shows the channel used, duration, qualification outcome, and any actions taken (bookings, CRM updates, etc.).

## Integrations Hub

Manage all your connected services — calendar providers, CRM platforms, notification channels. Each integration shows its connection status and last sync time.

## Settings

Configure organization-level settings including team members, roles and permissions, and API keys for webhook integrations.
