## How It Works

You start by **defining an agent** for a particular role — sales outreach, appointment booking, customer support, etc. Each agent is configured with a name, tone, objectives, and a knowledge base so it knows how to handle conversations.

Once created, your agent can be **linked to multiple channels** (inbound calls, SMS, WhatsApp, email) to handle incoming conversations, or run **outbound sequences** to proactively reach out to leads.

When a conversation happens, the **lead and conversation are automatically logged**. Conversation data, qualification scores, and outcomes are then **synced to your CRM** (HubSpot, Salesforce), sent to any external system via **webhooks**, and **notifications** are delivered through Slack or email to keep your team in the loop.

## Key Concepts

### Agents

An **agent** is your AI-powered representative. Each agent has a name, tone, role, objectives, and a knowledge base that shapes how it interacts with leads. You can create multiple agents for different use cases — SDR outreach, customer support, appointment booking, and more.

### Channels

Channels are how your agents communicate. Unibound supports both **inbound** channels (your agent receives and handles incoming calls and messages) and **outbound** channels (your agent proactively reaches out to leads via calls, SMS, WhatsApp, or email).

### Leads

A **lead** is any contact your agent interacts with. Leads are automatically created from conversations and enriched with qualification scores, interaction history, and CRM data. Filter and manage leads from the dashboard.

### Conversations

Every interaction between an agent and a lead is captured as a **conversation**. Conversations include full transcripts, message threads, channel used, duration, qualification outcome, and any actions taken (bookings, CRM updates, notifications).

### AI Escalations

When an agent encounters a situation it can't handle — a complex question, an upset lead, or a request outside its scope — it triggers an **escalation**. Escalations notify your team via Slack, email, or webhook so a human can step in seamlessly.
