The Dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in. It provides a real-time overview of your AI agents' performance across all channels.

## Time Period Selector

Use the **Period** dropdown in the top-right corner to filter all metrics by time range:

- **Today** -- activity from the current day
- **Yesterday** -- previous day only
- **Last 7 days** -- rolling weekly view
- **Last 30 days** -- default monthly view (selected by default)
- **Last year** -- full year overview

All stat cards show a **"vs last period"** comparison so you can spot trends at a glance.

## Performance Metrics

The top row of stat cards tracks your core outreach numbers:

| Metric              | What it measures                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Leads**           | Total unique leads your agents interacted with in the selected period             |
| **Conversations**   | Answered calls, email threads with replies, and active SMS/WhatsApp threads       |
| **Engaged**         | Leads who responded -- inbound messages or calls with 20+ seconds of conversation |
| **Meetings Booked** | Unique leads with a meeting scheduled (shows internal + external bookings)        |

## Efficiency Metrics

The second row of cards shows how effectively your agents are performing:

| Metric              | What it measures                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Engagement Rate** | Percentage of leads who responded to outreach                                             |
| **Booking Rate**    | Percentage of leads who booked a meeting                                                  |
| **Touchpoints**     | Total outbound interactions across all channels (calls, emails, SMS, WhatsApp)            |
| **Time Saved**      | Estimated time saved by AI automation (hover the info icon for the calculation breakdown) |

<Tip>
  **Time Saved Calculation:** - Call: 2 min base + call duration - Email: 3 min
  per response - SMS: 1 min per message - WhatsApp: 1 min per message - +5 min
  per meeting booked
</Tip>

## Recent Activity

The **Recent Activity** panel shows your latest conversation threads across all channels. You can:

- **Filter by channel** using the tabs: All, SMS, WhatsApp, Email, Calls
- **Search** by lead name, contact info, or agent name
- **Click any row** to view the full [conversation detail](/activity/conversation-details) page
- **Paginate** through results (10 per page)

Click **"See all"** to go to the full [Conversations](/activity/conversations) page.

## AI Escalations

The **AI Escalations** panel on the right shows conversations where AI has paused and needs your input. Each escalation displays:

- The **channel** icon (call, email, SMS, WhatsApp)
- The **lead name** and contact
- The **reason** the AI escalated
- A **timestamp** of when it occurred

Click any escalation to jump directly to the [conversation](#) (or use the link above). If there are more than 5 pending, click **"View all"** to see the complete list on the [AI Escalations](/activity/escalations) page.
