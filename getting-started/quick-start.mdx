Get your first AI agent up and running in under 5 minutes. This guide walks you through the key steps from creating an agent to launching your first conversation.

## Prerequisites

- A Unibound account — accounts are set up by a Unibound admin. Email [james@unibound.ai](mailto:james@unibound.ai) to get an account set up with 200 free credits.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Agent">
    From the dashboard, click **"New Agent"**. You'll be guided through a step-by-step setup flow to define your agent's profile, knowledge base, qualification questions, booking settings, and prompt. See the [Agent Profile](/agent-setup/agent-profile), [Knowledge Base](/agent-setup/knowledge-base), [Qualification](/agent-setup/qualification), [Booking](/agent-setup/booking), and [Review Prompt](/agent-setup/review-prompt) docs for details on each step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Phone & Email">
    Before your agent can communicate, you need to connect the accounts it will use. Purchase or bring your own phone number for calls, SMS, and WhatsApp, and connect a Gmail account for email. See [Phone Numbers](/configuration/phone-numbers) and [Email Accounts](/configuration/email-accounts) for setup instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to a Channel or Set Up Outreach">
    Now link your agent to a channel. You have two options:

    - **Inbound channels** — Your agent handles incoming calls, SMS, WhatsApp messages, or emails automatically. See [Calls](/channels/calls), [SMS](/channels/sms), [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp), or [Email](/channels/email).
    - **Outreach sequence** — Your agent proactively reaches out to leads via a multi-channel sequence triggered by a webhook. See [Outreach Sequence](/channels/outreach-sequence).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test & Launch">
    Test your agent before going live. For outbound sequences, use the [demo tool](/api-reference/testing-webhooks) to send a test webhook. For inbound channels, simply call or message the connected number. Once you're happy, activate the agent from the channel setup page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Pro tip:** Start with a single channel to get comfortable, then expand to multi-channel outreach once your agent's knowledge base and qualification flow are dialled in.
