3. Select your preferences:
   - Region (US or UK)
   - Number type (Local or Toll Free for US)
   - Area code (optional)
   - Specific digits (optional)
4. Choose an available number and complete purchase

</Info>

## Step 2: Create an Inbound Call Channel

1. Navigate to **Channels** from the sidebar
2. Click **"New Channel"** → select **Calls**

## Step 3: Configure Call Channel

Fill in all required fields:

**Basic Setup:**

- **Label** — Descriptive name for this channel (e.g., "Inbound Sales Calls", "Customer Support Line")
- **Phone Number** — Select the number you just purchased or imported
- **Agent** — Choose which agent should answer calls

**Call Greeting:**

- **Opening Line** — What the agent says when answering (e.g., "Hi, thanks for calling! How can I help you today?")

<Warning>
  Keep your opening line concise (under 15 seconds). Callers expect a response
  within 2-3 seconds. Long greetings increase hang-up rates.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Activate the Channel

1. Review all settings
2. Toggle the channel to **Live**
3. Calls to your number now route to your AI agent

## Understanding Call Flow

When a call comes in:

1. Agent answers with your configured opening line
2. Conversation flows naturally based on agent's knowledge and tone
3. Qualification questions are woven into discussion
4. If qualification is positive, agent offers to:
   - Book a meeting (if configured)
   - Transfer to a human agent
   - Schedule a follow-up
5. Call ends and is logged automatically
6. Webhook events fire (if configured for CRM integration)

## Call Recording & Compliance

All calls are:

- **Recorded automatically** — Available for quality review
- **Transcribed** — Full transcripts stored for reference
- **Compliant** — Follows standard call recording practices

Access recordings and transcripts in the conversation history.

## Handling Common Issues

**Calls aren't routing:**

- Verify the channel is set to **Live**
- Check that your phone number is properly configured
- Ensure the agent is active and has no errors

**Agent isn't speaking clearly:**

- Review the agent's Voice and Tone settings
- Ensure your Opening Line is concise
- Test with a different voice option

**Caller isn't understood:**

- Review your Knowledge Base for clarity
- Check Qualification Questions are understandable
- Test with different phrasing

## Outbound Calls

To make outbound calls to leads:

See [Create Outreach Sequences](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) and add a **Call** step.

## Step 5: Test Your Setup

Call your phone number and verify:

- Agent answers with your opening line
- Conversation is clear and natural
- Agent understands your responses
- Call is logged in conversations

## Advanced Configuration

Once comfortable, consider:

- **Multiple agents** — Create different agents for different teams
- **Outreach sequences** — Add outbound calling capabilities
- **Integrations** — Connect to HubSpot, Salesforce, or webhooks for CRM logging
- **Notifications** — Get alerted when calls are qualified or escalated
