## Prerequisites

- A created AI agent (see [Set Up Your First AI Agent](/tutorials/setup-inbound-agent))
- A Twilio account with WhatsApp capability
- A phone number with WhatsApp enabled (see [Phone Numbers](/configuration/phone-numbers))

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Ensure WhatsApp Is Enabled on Your Number

Go to **Configuration → Phone Numbers** and verify your Twilio number has WhatsApp capability. If not, enable it in your Twilio dashboard.

### 2. Create a WhatsApp Channel

Navigate to **Channels** and click **"New Channel"** → select **WhatsApp**.

### 3. Configure the Channel

Fill in the following details:

- **Label** — Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g., "Inbound WhatsApp", "WhatsApp Support")
- **Phone Number** — Select a Twilio number with WhatsApp capability. Numbers already in use are disabled
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will handle WhatsApp messages

### 4. Enable Auto Follow-Up (Optional)

If you want your agent to send follow-up messages when the lead doesn't respond:

- Toggle **"Enable Auto Follow-Up"**
- Set delays for each follow-up (within WhatsApp's 24-hour messaging window)

<Info>
  **24-hour window:** WhatsApp enforces a 24-hour messaging window. After 24
  hours of no customer messages, your agent must use an approved template to
  re-initiate contact. Unibound tracks these windows automatically.
</Info>

### 5. Configure Webhook (May Be Required)

After saving:

1. Unibound will attempt automatic webhook configuration
2. If manual setup is needed, you'll see the webhook URL and instructions
3. Copy the webhook URL and configure it in your Twilio WhatsApp dashboard

### 6. Activate the Channel

Toggle the channel to **Live**. Your agent can now handle incoming WhatsApp messages.

## WhatsApp Conversation Flow

Once activated:

1. A lead messages your WhatsApp number
2. Your agent reads the conversation history
3. The agent composes a context-aware reply based on its knowledge base
4. The agent can qualify leads and facilitate meetings
5. If the 24-hour window expires, approved templates are used for re-engagement

## Outbound WhatsApp

To send WhatsApp messages proactively, set up an [Outreach Sequence](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) with a **WhatsApp** step. Note that outbound messages require pre-approved templates from Twilio's Content API.
