- A created and activated AI agent (see [Set Up Your First Agent](/tutorials/setup-agent))
- A Twilio account with WhatsApp enabled
- A phone number with WhatsApp capability
- Meta WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) connected to Twilio
- Business verification with Meta (for high volume messaging)

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Verify WhatsApp capability on your Twilio number
- Create a WhatsApp inbound channel
- Configure the webhook connection
- Understand WhatsApp's 24-hour window
- Set up auto follow-ups within constraints
- Test incoming WhatsApp messages

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, confirm you have:

- [ ] Twilio account with verified status
- [ ] WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) created in Meta Business Suite
- [ ] WABA connected to your Twilio account
- [ ] Phone number assigned to your WABA
- [ ] WhatsApp Business Profile approved by Meta
- [ ] Your phone number verified as WhatsApp-capable in Twilio

<Info>
  **Getting started:** If you don't have WhatsApp enabled yet, contact Twilio
  support to request WhatsApp API access. Meta approval typically takes 24-48
  hours.
</Info>

## Step 1: Verify WhatsApp Capability

1. Go to **Configuration → Phone Numbers**
2. Select your phone number
3. Confirm WhatsApp is enabled
4. If not enabled:
   - Log into Twilio
   - Go to Messaging → WhatsApp
   - Verify your WABA and enable the number

## Step 2: Create a WhatsApp Channel

1. Navigate to **Channels** from sidebar
2. Click **"New Channel"** → select **WhatsApp**

## Step 3: Configure WhatsApp Channel

Fill in required fields:

**Basic Setup:**

- **Label** — Descriptive name (e.g., "WhatsApp Support", "WhatsApp Sales")
- **Phone Number** — Select a Twilio number with WhatsApp enabled
- **Agent** — Choose which agent should handle messages

Numbers already assigned to other WhatsApp agents are disabled.

## Step 4: Configure Auto Follow-Up (Optional)

Set up follow-up messages within WhatsApp's 24-hour window:

1. Toggle **"Enable Auto Follow-Up"**
2. Set follow-up delays:
   - After 2 hours
   - After 6 hours
   - After 12 hours
   - (Or your preferred intervals)

<Warning>
  **Critical:** All follow-ups must occur within 24 hours of the customer's last
  message. After 24 hours, you must use an approved template to re-initiate
  contact. Unibound enforces this automatically.
</Warning>

## Step 5: Configure Webhook

After saving, Unibound attempts automatic webhook configuration:

**If automatic succeeds:**

- Your channel is ready to use
- WhatsApp messages now route to your agent

**If manual setup is required:**

1. You'll see your webhook URL displayed
2. Log into your Twilio account
3. Go to Messaging → WhatsApp → Sandbox Settings (or production settings)
4. Find the Webhook field
5. Paste your Unibound webhook URL
6. Save and test in Twilio

## Step 6: Activate the Channel

1. Review all settings
2. Toggle the channel to **Live**
3. WhatsApp messages to your number now reach your agent

## Understanding WhatsApp's 24-Hour Window

WhatsApp enforces strict rules on when you can message:

**The 24-Hour Window:**

- Starts when customer sends a message to you
- Your agent can freely respond for 24 hours
- After 24 hours, standard messaging is blocked

**Re-engaging After 24 Hours:**

To message after the window expires, you must use an **approved template:**

1. Create a WhatsApp template in Meta Business Manager
2. Get it approved by Meta (usually 24-48 hours)
3. Add the template to your Unibound [Outreach Sequence](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) as a WhatsApp step
4. The template message resets the 24-hour window

<Info>
  **Approved templates** are required for marketing, notifications, and other
  non-conversation messages. Use them to re-engage leads who haven't messaged in
  over 24 hours.
</Info>

## Auto Follow-Up Strategy

**Smart follow-up timing:**

- **2 hours** — Quick check-in or reminder
- **6 hours** — Offer additional value or answer follow-up questions
- **12 hours** — Final offer or call-to-action before 24-hour window closes

Example: Lead reaches out at 9 AM

- 11 AM → First follow-up reminder
- 3 PM → Second offering additional info
- 9 PM → Final CTA (just in time before 24-hour window)

## WhatsApp Conversation Flow

When someone messages your WhatsApp number:

1. Your agent receives the message
2. Agent reads full conversation history
3. Agent composes a reply based on knowledge base
4. Conversation continues naturally
5. Agent can:
   - Qualify the lead
   - Provide information
   - Schedule meetings
   - Use media (images, PDFs)
6. All within the 24-hour window
7. Auto follow-ups trigger if configured

## Testing Your Setup

1. Add your WhatsApp number to a personal contact
2. Send a test message
3. Verify your agent responds appropriately
4. Test a full conversation flow
5. Test auto follow-ups if enabled
6. Review conversation in dashboard
