## Prerequisites

- A created AI agent (see [Set Up Your First AI Agent](/tutorials/setup-inbound-agent))
- A phone number with SMS capability (see [Phone Numbers](/configuration/phone-numbers))

## SMS Requirements

<Warning>
  **US numbers:** US phone numbers (+1) require A2P (Application-to-Person)
  10DLC registration. Check your Twilio compliance status to ensure SMS is
  enabled.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Ensure Your Number Supports SMS

Go to **Configuration → Phone Numbers** and verify your phone number has SMS capability enabled. If you're using a Twilio number, check your Twilio dashboard to confirm.

### 2. Create an SMS Channel

Navigate to **Channels** and click **"New Channel"** → select **SMS**.

### 3. Configure the Channel

Fill in the following details:

- **Label** — Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g., "Inbound SMS Agent", "SMS Support")
- **Phone Number** — Select a phone number with SMS enabled. Numbers already used by another SMS agent are disabled
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will handle incoming SMS messages

### 4. Enable Auto Follow-Up (Optional)

If you want your agent to send follow-up messages when the lead doesn't respond:

- Toggle **"Enable Auto Follow-Up"**
- Set delays for each follow-up (e.g., 1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day)
- Follow-up delays are relative to the previous message

### 5. Activate the Channel

Toggle the channel to **Live**. This enables SMS routing so incoming messages reach your agent.

## SMS Conversation Flow

Once activated:

1. A lead texts your number
2. Your agent reads the conversation history
3. The agent composes a context-aware reply based on its knowledge base and configuration
4. Qualification questions are woven into the text conversation
5. Auto follow-ups trigger if the lead doesn't respond

## Webhook Configuration

Unibound automatically configures your Twilio SMS webhook when you save and activate the channel. For some number types, you may need to manually add the webhook — instructions will be displayed if needed.

## Outbound SMS

To send SMS messages proactively, set up an [Outreach Sequence](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) and add an **SMS** step to it.
