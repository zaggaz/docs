## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a New Agent

From the dashboard, click **"New Agent"**. You'll be guided through a multi-step setup wizard.

### 2. Configure Agent Profile

The first step is setting up your agent's profile:

- **Agent Name** — Choose a name your agent will introduce itself as (e.g., "Sarah", "Alex")
- **Company Name** — The company your agent represents
- **Role** — The professional role (e.g., Sales Development Representative, Customer Success Manager)
- **Voice** — Select from pre-built voice options (US/UK accents, male/female). You can also provide a custom ElevenLabs voice ID
- **Tone** — Choose how your agent communicates: Professional, Friendly, Casual, Formal, or Enthusiastic

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Match the tone to your audience. B2B prospects typically respond
  better to a professional tone, while SMB and consumer audiences prefer
  friendly or casual.
</Tip>

- **Objective** — Define what your agent should accomplish (e.g., "Qualify inbound leads and book meetings with our sales team")

### 3. Set Up Knowledge Base

Provide information your agent should use when having conversations. This can include:

- Product information and pricing
- FAQs about your services
- Company background and mission
- Common objections and how to handle them

See the [Knowledge Base](/agent-setup/knowledge-base) documentation for detailed setup instructions.

### 4. Configure Qualification Questions

Define the qualification flow to help your agent identify high-value leads. Set up questions that reveal buying intent, budget, timeline, and other relevant criteria.

See the [Qualification](/agent-setup/qualification) documentation for more details.

### 5. Set Up Booking (Optional)

If you want your agent to book meetings, connect your calendar and configure:

- Which calendar to use (Google Calendar)
- Meeting duration
- Timezone and available hours
- Lead time before meetings can be booked

See the [Booking](/agent-setup/booking) documentation for setup instructions.

### 6. Review and Edit the Prompt

Unibound auto-generates a system prompt based on all your configuration. Review it, edit as needed, and then activate your agent.

See the [Review Prompt](/agent-setup/review-prompt) documentation for more information.
