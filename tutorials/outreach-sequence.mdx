## Prerequisites

- A created AI agent (see [Set Up Your First AI Agent](/tutorials/setup-inbound-agent))
- At least one configured resource (phone number for calls/SMS/WhatsApp, or Gmail account for email)

## What Is an Outreach Sequence?

An outreach sequence is a webhook-triggered, multi-channel workflow. When your external system (CRM, form tool, automation platform) sends a webhook, Unibound runs a series of steps to engage the lead with calls, SMS, emails, or WhatsApp messages.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Create a New Outreach Sequence

Navigate to **Channels** and click **"New Channel"** → select **Outreach Sequence**.

### 2. Configure Resources

First, set up the resources your sequence will use:

- **Label** — Give your sequence a descriptive name (e.g., "Lead Follow-up", "Sales Outreach")
- **Phone Number** — (Optional) Enable Call, SMS, and WhatsApp steps by selecting a phone number
- **Email Account** — (Optional) Enable Email steps by selecting a Gmail account
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will run the sequence

### 3. Add Sequence Steps

Click **"Add Step"** to define each action in your sequence:

**Call Step:**

- Set a delay before the call (in minutes or hours)
- Optionally customize the opening line
- The agent will call the lead automatically

**SMS Step:**

- Set a delay before the message
- Choose between AI-generated or manual template
- For templates, use variables like `{firstName}` or `{company}`

**Email Step:**

- Set a delay before the email
- Choose between AI-generated or manual template
- Optionally mark as a reply to a previous email
- Set a subject line (AI can generate if left blank)

**WhatsApp Step:**

- Set a delay before the message
- Select a pre-approved WhatsApp template
- Map variables to your lead data

### 4. Configure Step Options

For each step, you can set:

- **Delay** — Time to wait before executing (minutes, hours, or days)
- **Run Regardless** — (Steps after the first) Execute this step even if a previous call was answered or a message was replied to

<Info>
  **Sequence behavior:** Steps execute in order after their configured delay. If
  the lead picks up a call or replies to a message, subsequent steps pause for
  that channel. "Run Regardless" overrides this behavior.
</Info>

### 5. Test Your Sequence

After saving, your webhook URL is displayed. Use the built-in test panel to:

1. Enter a sample JSON body with lead details
2. Click **"Send Test"**
3. Watch the sequence execute in real-time

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "number": "+1234567890",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "context": "Lead from website demo",
  "customProperties": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "company": "Acme Corp"
  }
}
```

### 6. Activate the Sequence

Toggle the sequence to **Active** to start processing incoming webhook triggers. When deactivated, webhook requests are rejected.

## Triggering Your Sequence

Send a POST request to your webhook URL with the lead data:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unibound.ai/webhook/... \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "number": "+1234567890",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "customProperties": {
      "firstName": "John",
      "company": "Acme Corp"
    }
  }'
```

## Template Variables

Use variables in SMS, Email, and WhatsApp steps:

- `{name}` — Lead's full name
- `{email}` — Lead's email address
- `{number}` — Lead's phone number
- Any key from `customProperties` — e.g., `{firstName}`, `{company}`

## Webhook Events

Unibound sends callback events when conversations complete. See [Webhook Events](/api-reference/webhook-events) for details.
