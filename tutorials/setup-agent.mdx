## Prerequisites

- Active Unibound account with available credits
- Clarity on your use case (sales, support, appointment booking, etc.)

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Create a new AI agent from scratch
- Configure the agent's personality and voice
- Set up knowledge base with your information
- Create qualification questions
- Configure optional meeting booking
- Review and customize the system prompt

## Creating Your Agent

### 1. Start the Agent Creation Flow

From the dashboard, click **"New Agent"**. This opens a step-by-step wizard.

### 2. Configure Agent Profile

Define who your agent is:

- **Agent Name** — The name your agent introduces itself with (e.g., "Sarah", "Alex")
- **Company Name** — Your company or organization name
- **Role** — Agent's professional role (e.g., Sales Development Representative, Customer Support Specialist)
- **Voice** — Choose from pre-built voices (male/female, US/UK accents) or provide a custom ElevenLabs voice ID
- **Tone** — Communication style: Professional, Friendly, Casual, Formal, or Enthusiastic

<Tip>
  Match your tone to your audience. Enterprise B2B typically prefers
  professional, while SMB and consumer audiences respond better to friendly or
  casual.
</Tip>

- **Objective** — What the agent should accomplish (e.g., "Qualify leads and book demos", "Answer customer support questions")

### 3. Set Up Knowledge Base

Your knowledge base teaches the agent how to handle conversations:

- **Product Information** — Features, pricing, packages, and benefits
- **Company Background** — Mission, values, team, and differentiators
- **FAQs** — Common questions and answers
- **Objection Handling** — How to address common concerns
- **Process Documentation** — Steps for booking, onboarding, etc.

<Info>
  The better your knowledge base, the better your agent performs. Include
  specific details, pricing, policies, and guidelines.
</Info>

### 4. Create Qualification Questions

Design questions to identify high-value leads:

- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What is their budget?
- What's their timeline?
- Who is the decision maker?
- How soon do they need a solution?

These questions are naturally woven into conversations.

### 5. Set Up Meeting Booking (Optional)

If you want your agent to book meetings:

- **Calendar** — Connect Google Calendar
- **Duration** — How long meetings should be (30 min, 60 min, etc.)
- **Availability** — Which calendars and hours are available
- **Lead Time** — Minimum time before a meeting can be booked
- **Timezone** — What timezone to use for availability

### 6. Review the Prompt

Unibound auto-generates a system prompt from your configuration. Review it and edit as needed:

- Add specific instructions or guardrails
- Clarify decision-making rules
- Set escalation triggers
- Define conversational boundaries

### 7. Activate Your Agent

Once satisfied, click **"Create Agent"**. Your agent is now ready to handle conversations.

## Next Steps

Now that your agent is created, you can:

- [Set up phone calls](/tutorials/phone-agent)
- [Enable SMS messaging](/tutorials/sms-agent)
- [Connect WhatsApp](/tutorials/whatsapp-agent)
- [Configure email conversations](/tutorials/email-agent)
- [Create outreach sequences](/tutorials/outreach-sequence)

## Tips for Success

- **Test thoroughly** — Create a test agent first to understand the platform
- **Start simple** — Begin with one channel before expanding
- **Iterate quickly** — You can edit everything later (except the agent name)
- **Use real data** — Add actual products, pricing, and SOPs to your knowledge base
- **Monitor quality** — Review conversations to refine your agent's behavior
