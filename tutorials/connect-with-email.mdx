## Prerequisites

- A created AI agent (see [Set Up Your First AI Agent](/tutorials/setup-inbound-agent))
- A Gmail account (Outlook coming soon)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Connect Your Gmail Account

Go to **Configuration → Email Accounts** and click **"Connect Gmail"**.

Unibound will open an OAuth flow where you:

1. Sign in with your Gmail account
2. Authorize Unibound to send and receive emails on your behalf
3. Confirm the connection

<Info>
  **Email providers:** Gmail is fully supported. Outlook support is coming soon.
  You can connect multiple Gmail accounts if needed.
</Info>

### 2. Create an Email Channel

Navigate to **Channels** and click **"New Channel"** → select **Email**.

### 3. Configure the Channel

Fill in the following details:

- **Label** — Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g., "Inbound Sales Email", "Support Email")
- **Email Account** — Select the Gmail account your agent will use to send and receive emails
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will handle incoming emails

### 4. Set Response Criteria (Optional)

Control which emails your agent responds to:

- **Replies Only Mode** — Enable if you only want the agent to respond to replies from your outreach campaigns
- **Response Criteria** — Describe which emails should trigger a response (e.g., "Only respond to product inquiries, pricing, or demo requests. Ignore newsletters and automated notifications."). Leave blank to respond to all business-related emails.

### 5. Enable Auto Follow-Up (Optional)

If you want your agent to send follow-up emails when the lead doesn't respond:

- Toggle **"Enable Auto Follow-Up"**
- Set delays for each follow-up (in hours or days)
- Follow-ups are sent on the same thread

### 6. Activate the Channel

Toggle the channel to **Live**. Your agent can now handle incoming email conversations.

## Email Conversation Flow

Once activated:

1. An email arrives at your Gmail inbox
2. Your agent reads the email and full conversation history
3. The agent composes a context-aware reply based on its knowledge base
4. The agent can qualify the lead and facilitate meetings
5. Multiple emails stay on the same thread
6. Auto follow-ups trigger if the lead doesn't respond

## Outbound Email

To send email campaigns proactively, set up an [Outreach Sequence](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) with an **Email** step. You can:

- Write manual templates with variables like `{firstName}` or `{company}`
- Let the AI generate the email body
- Chain multiple emails as replies on the same thread

## Email Threads

Your agent maintains full context across entire email threads, ensuring coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
