## Prerequisites

- A created and activated AI agent (see [Set Up Your First Agent](/tutorials/setup-agent))

- Optional: Gmail account admin access for workspace configuration

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Connect a Gmail account to Unibound
- Create an email inbound channel
- Configure response criteria
- Set up auto follow-ups
- Activate email conversations
- Test incoming emails

## Gmail Account Setup

### Gmail Account Types Supported

**Personal Gmail Accounts:**

- ✅ Fully supported
- ✅ Easiest to set up
- ✅ Recommended for testing and small teams

**Google Workspace Accounts:**

- ✅ Supported for workspace admins
- ✅ Requires OAuth app verification
- ⏳ Outlook support coming soon

<Info>
  For Google Workspace, ensure your workspace admin has authorized Unibound to
  access Gmail. Contact your workspace administrator for help.
</Info>

## Step 1: Connect Your Gmail Account

### Navigate to Email Accounts

1. Go to **Configuration → Email Accounts**
2. Click **"Connect Gmail"**
3. A OAuth authorization window opens

### Authorize Unibound

In the authorization screen:

1. Sign in with your Gmail account (if not already signed in)
2. Review the permissions Unibound is requesting:
   - Read and send emails
   - Manage mailbox labels
   - Modify Gmail settings
3. Click **"Allow"** or **"Grant Access"**
4. You'll be redirected back to Unibound

### Verify Connection

After authorization:

1. You should see your Gmail account listed under Email Accounts
2. Status should show "Connected"
3. You're ready to create an email channel

<Warning>
  If authorization fails, ensure: - You're using the correct Gmail account - 2FA
  is enabled (you may need to generate an app password) - Your Gmail account
  allows less secure app access (check Gmail settings)
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create an Email Channel

1. Navigate to **Channels** from sidebar
2. Click **"New Channel"** → select **Email**

## Step 3: Configure Email Settings

Fill in required fields:

**Basic Setup:**

- **Label** — Descriptive name (e.g., "Inbound Sales Email", "Support Email")
- **Email Account** — Select the Gmail account you just connected
- **Agent** — Choose which agent should handle emails

## Step 4: Set Response Criteria

Configure which emails your agent should respond to:

### Replies Only Mode

Toggle **"Replies Only"** if:

- You only want responses to emails YOU initiated
- You're running email outreach campaigns
- You want to avoid responding to cold incoming emails

Leave OFF if your agent should respond to all incoming emails.

### Custom Response Criteria

Describe which emails should get responses:

**Examples:**

- "Only respond to product inquiries, pricing questions, and demo requests"
- "Ignore newsletters, automated notifications, and spam"
- "Respond to support-related emails and feature requests"
- "Only respond to emails from our target customer profiles"

Leave blank to respond to all business-relevant emails.

## Step 5: Configure Auto Follow-Up (Optional)

Set up automatic follow-up emails if leads don't respond:

1. Toggle **"Enable Auto Follow-Up"**
2. Set follow-up intervals:
   - After 2 hours
   - After 1 day
   - After 3 days
   - (Add as many as needed)

<Tip>
  Space follow-ups reasonably. Too many create a spammy feel; too few and you
  won't re-engage. Typical pattern: 2 hours, 1 day, 3 days.
</Tip>

**Follow-up behavior:**

- Each follow-up sent on the same thread
- Agent reads conversation history before composing
- Follow-ups stop once the lead responds

## Step 6: Activate the Channel

1. Review all your email channel settings
2. Toggle the channel to **Live**
3. Emails to your Gmail account now route to your agent

## Email Conversation Flow

When an email arrives:

1. Unibound checks if it matches your response criteria
2. Your agent reads the email and full conversation history
3. Agent composes a context-aware reply based on knowledge base
4. Response is sent from your Gmail account
5. Conversation continues on the same thread
6. Agent maintains context across multiple emails
7. Auto follow-ups trigger if configured and no response received

## Email Threading

Your agent understands email threads:

- **Full history context** — Agent knows the entire conversation history
- **Proper quoting** — Agent references previous messages appropriately
- **Subject line continuity** — Replies maintain original subject (Re: Your Subject)
- **Professional formatting** — Maintains all email conventions

## Handling Different Email Types

**Marketing/Sales Email:**

- Agent can discuss pricing, features, and benefits
- Can qualify the lead
- Can book meetings or demos

**Support Email:**

- Agent can answer technical questions
- Can escalate complex issues
- Can provide troubleshooting steps

**Feedback/Suggestion Email:**

- Agent can acknowledge and thank the sender
- Can ask follow-up questions
- Can escalate to product team if appropriate

## Testing Your Email Setup

1. Send a test email to your Gmail account from another email address
2. Verify your agent responds appropriately
3. Test a full conversation thread (multiple exchanges)
4. Test that auto follow-ups trigger correctly
5. Review conversation in dashboard for quality

## Outbound Email Campaigns

Once comfortable with inbound email:

Set up [Outreach Sequences](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) with email steps to:

- Send bulk prospecting campaigns
- Create templated sequences with variables
- Chain multiple emails on the same thread
- Mix emails with other channels (email → SMS → call)

## Gmail Best Practices

**Keep your inbox clean:**

- Unibound auto-logs conversations
- Archive handled emails to reduce clutter
- Use Gmail labels to organize by type

**Security considerations:**

- Keep your Gmail account password secure
- Enable 2FA on Gmail account
- Monitor connected applications in Gmail settings
- Disconnect Unibound if you no longer use it

**Avoiding spam filters:**

- Add your company domain to SPF/DKIM records
- Keep response quality high (avoid generic templates)
- Monitor bounce rates
- Respect email best practices

## Troubleshooting

**Agent not responding to emails:**

- Verify channel is **Live**
- Check your email response criteria
- Review agent configuration and knowledge base
- Test with simple emails first

**Emails going to spam:**

- Check your Gmail settings
- Verify email authentication (SPF, DKIM)
- Review email content for spam triggers
- Ensure company domain is properly configured

**Can't connect Gmail:**

- Verify you authorized Unibound
- Check Gmail account is active
- Try reconnecting: disconnect and authorize again
- If using Workspace, contact your admin

**Auto follow-ups not triggering:**

- Check that delays are configured
- Ensure agent hasn't been deactivated
- Review conversation status in dashboard
