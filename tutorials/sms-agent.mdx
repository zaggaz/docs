## Prerequisites

- A created and activated AI agent (see [Set Up Your First Agent](/tutorials/setup-agent))
- A phone number with SMS capability (see [Set Up Phone Calls](/tutorials/phone-agent) to get one)
- For US numbers: A2P (Application-to-Person) 10DLC registration (Twilio requirement)

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Verify SMS capability on your phone number
- Create an SMS inbound channel
- Configure auto-followups
- Activate SMS messaging
- Test incoming text messages
- Handle common SMS scenarios

## Before You Start: SMS Requirements

### Check Your Phone Number

1. Go to **Configuration → Phone Numbers**
2. Verify your number has SMS enabled
3. If you're using a Twilio number, check your Twilio dashboard

### US Phone Numbers: A2P Registration

<Warning>
  **US Requirement:** US phone numbers (+1) require A2P 10DLC registration with
  Twilio before SMS can be sent or received. This is a compliance requirement.
</Warning>

To check your A2P status:

1. Log into your Twilio account
2. Navigate to Programmable SMS → Phone Numbers
3. Verify your number shows "A2P Approved"
4. If not approved, submit your A2P registration to Twilio

### International Numbers

- **UK numbers** — Usually pre-approved for SMS
- **Other regions** — Check Twilio documentation for your country

## Step 1: Create an SMS Channel

1. Navigate to **Channels** from sidebar
2. Click **"New Channel"** → select **SMS**

## Step 2: Configure SMS Settings

Fill in all required fields:

**Basic Setup:**

- **Label** — Descriptive name (e.g., "Inbound SMS", "SMS Support Line")
- **Phone Number** — Select a number with SMS enabled
- **Agent** — Choose which agent should handle SMS messages

<Info>
  Numbers already assigned to other SMS agents are grayed out. Each agent can
  have one dedicated number.
</Info>

## Step 3: Configure Auto Follow-Up (Optional)

Add automatic follow-up messages if a lead doesn't respond:

1. Toggle **"Enable Auto Follow-Up"**
2. Set follow-up intervals:
   - After 1 hour
   - After 3 hours
   - After 1 day
   - (Add as many as you want)

<Tip>
  Each delay is relative to the previous message. Use follow-ups to re-engage
  silent leads within reasonable time windows.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Webhook Configuration

Unibound automatically configures your Twilio webhook when you save:

- If automatic setup succeeds, you're done
- If manual setup is needed, you'll see instructions to:
  - Copy your webhook URL
  - Add it to your Twilio account
  - Verify the webhook is active

## Step 5: Activate the Channel

1. Review your configuration
2. Toggle the channel to **Live**
3. SMS to your number now routes to your agent

## SMS Conversation Flow

When someone texts your number:

1. Agent receives the message and reads conversation history
2. Agent composes a context-aware text reply
3. Conversation continues naturally via SMS
4. Qualification questions are asked in text format
5. Agent can offer to book meetings or escalate
6. Messages stay on one thread for continuity
7. Auto follow-ups trigger if configured and no reply is received

## Understanding SMS Behavior

**When the agent responds:**

- Reads full conversation history before composing response
- Keeps messages concise and text-appropriate (no long paragraphs)
- Maintains conversation context across multiple exchanges
- Respects the lead's time zone and working hours

**Message limits:**

- No character limit imposed by Unibound
- SMS industry standard is 160 characters per message
- Longer messages are split automatically by carriers

**Conversation state:**

- Agent knows if it's first message or ongoing conversation
- Full history is available to agent for context
- Agent can reference previous topics naturally

## Testing Your SMS Setup

1. Send a text to your configured number
2. Verify agent responds with appropriate message
3. Test qualification flow
4. Test follow-up messages if enabled
5. Review conversation in dashboard

## Common SMS Scenarios

**Lead responds after 1 day:**

- Agent remembers full conversation context
- Can pick up where left off naturally
- Auto follow-ups stop once lead responds

**Multiple follow-ups:**

- Each is sent only if no response to previous
- Can be relevant to different aspects of offer
- Space them out reasonably (3 hours to 1 day)

**Opt-out requests:**

- Train your agent to recognize opt-out requests
- Configure escalation to human review
- Never send to opted-out numbers

## Troubleshooting

**No messages arriving:**

- Verify channel is **Live**
- Check phone number SMS capability
- Confirm A2P registration (US) is active
- Wait 30 seconds after activation for webhook to sync

**Incorrect responses:**

- Review your agent's knowledge base for clarity
- Check that response criteria are configured
- Test with different message types and questions

**Webhook not syncing:**

- Use manual webhook configuration instructions
- Verify Twilio webhook URL matches exactly
- Test webhook with Twilio's webhook debugger

## Advanced Setup

Once comfortable with basic SMS:

- **Outbound SMS** — Add SMS steps to [outreach sequences](/tutorials/outreach-sequence)
- **Template variables** — Use custom properties like `{firstName}` in templates
- **CRM integration** — Connect HubSpot or Salesforce to log SMS conversations
- **Notifications** — Get alerts for qualified leads or escalations
