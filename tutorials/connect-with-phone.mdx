## Prerequisites

- A created AI agent (see [Set Up Your First AI Agent](/tutorials/setup-inbound-agent))
- A phone number connected to your Unibound account (see [Phone Numbers](/configuration/phone-numbers))

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Get a Phone Number

First, you need a phone number for your agent to use:

- Go to **Configuration → Phone Numbers**
- Click **"Get a Phone Number"** to purchase a new number through Unibound
- Select your region (US or UK), number type, and preferences
- Or use **"Bring Your Own"** to import an existing Twilio number

Once your number is active, you can assign it to your agent.

### 2. Create an Inbound Call Channel

Navigate to **Channels** and click **"New Channel"** → select **Calls**.

### 3. Configure the Channel

Fill in the following details:

- **Label** — Give your channel a descriptive name (e.g., "Inbound Sales", "Customer Support")
- **Phone Number** — Select the phone number your agent will use
- **Agent** — Choose which agent will handle incoming calls
- **Opening Line** — Define what the agent says when answering (e.g., "Hello! Thank you for calling. How can I help you today?")

<Warning>
  **Keep it concise:** Callers expect a response within 2–3 seconds. Long
  greetings can lead to hang-ups.
</Warning>

### 4. Activate the Channel

Toggle the channel to **Live**. This sets up call routing so incoming calls reach your AI agent.

## Call Flow

Once activated:

1. A caller dials your number
2. Your agent answers with the configured opening line
3. The conversation flows naturally based on the agent's knowledge and configuration
4. Qualification questions are woven into the conversation
5. If qualified, the agent offers to book a meeting
6. Post-call actions trigger automatically (CRM logging, notifications, etc.)

## Call Recording

All calls are recorded and transcribed automatically. You can review recordings and transcripts in the conversation history for quality assurance and compliance.

## Outbound Calls

To make outbound calls, set up an [Outreach Sequence](/tutorials/outreach-sequence) and add a **Call** step to it.
