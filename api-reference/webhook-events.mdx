Unibound can send outbound webhook notifications to your systems when important events occur — such as when a conversation ends, a meeting is booked, or an escalation is triggered. Configure these in [Integrations → Outbound Webhooks](/configuration/integrations#outbound-webhooks).

## How It Works

When you set up an outbound webhook in your [integrations settings](/configuration/integrations#outbound-webhooks), Unibound will POST event payloads to your configured URL whenever a conversation completes. This happens automatically at the end of each interaction — after the call ends, the email thread concludes, or the messaging exchange finishes.

## Event Payload

The webhook payload includes the full conversation outcome — lead details, qualification answers, extracted data, booking status, and escalation flags.

```json title="Example: conversation ended payload"
{
  "event": "conversation.ended",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:05:30Z",

  },
  "channel": "call",
  "lead": {
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "phone_number": "+14155551234",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "status": "qualified"
  },
  "conversation": {
    "duration_seconds": 180,
    "meeting_booked": true,
    "meeting_booked_at": "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z",
    "call_went_smoothly": true,
    "requires_action": false,
    "requires_action_reason": null
  },
  "extracted_data": {
    "summary": "Customer interested in Enterprise plan, team of 15 people...",
    "budget": "$50k-$100k",
    "team_size": "15",
    "timeline": "Q2 2025"
  },
  "qualification": {
    "What is your budget range?": "$50k-$100k",
    "How many team members?": "15",
    "What is your timeline?": "Q2 2025"
  }
}
```

## Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `conversation.requires_action` | Whether the AI flagged this for human follow-up (see [AI Escalations](/activity/escalations)) |
| `conversation.requires_action_reason` | Detailed explanation of why escalation was triggered |
| `conversation.call_went_smoothly` | Whether the call flowed naturally without issues |
| `conversation.meeting_booked` | Whether a meeting was successfully booked |
| `extracted_data` | Fields extracted by the AI (see [Data Extraction](/data/data-extraction)) |
| `qualification` | Answers to your configured qualification questions |

<Tip>
**Use with automation tools:** Point your outbound webhook at a Zapier webhook, n8n endpoint, or any HTTP-capable automation platform to trigger follow-up workflows — CRM updates, Slack notifications, task creation, and more.

## Setting Up Outbound Webhooks

Go to [Integrations → Outbound Webhooks](/configuration/integrations#outbound-webhooks) to configure your webhook URL. All conversation-end events for all agents in your organization will be sent to this URL.
