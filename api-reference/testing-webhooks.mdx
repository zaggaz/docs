Before connecting your live lead sources, use the built-in demo tool at [unibound.ai/demo](https://unibound.ai/demo) to test your webhook integration end-to-end.

## Using the Demo Tool

The demo page at [**unibound.ai/demo**](https://unibound.ai/demo) lets you send test webhook payloads to any channel and see the resulting sequence in real-time.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your webhook URL">
    Copy the webhook URL from your channel's setup page (under **Test & Launch**). You can also open the demo directly from the channel setup — the URL will be pre-filled.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in lead details">
    Enter a name, email, and optionally a phone number and context. Add any custom properties you've defined in your sequence templates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the test">
    Click **Send**. The demo tool will fire the webhook and display the response — including the full scheduled sequence with channels, times, and delays.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch the sequence">
    The right panel shows the scheduled sequence items — which channels will fire, the delay between each step, and the status. Your agent will execute the sequence in real-time, and you can monitor it from the [Conversations](/activity/conversations) page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Mode

When testing from the channel setup page, the webhook is sent with a `test=true` parameter. In test mode:

- Only the first step of the sequence runs (no retries or follow-ups)
- Conversations are marked with a "Test" badge in the dashboard
- Test calls and messages are excluded from lead analytics

<Info>
**Test authentication:** Test calls from the channel setup page require an active session for security. The demo tool at unibound.ai/demo does not require authentication — it uses the webhook token directly.
</Info>

## Testing Inbound Channels

For inbound channels (calls, SMS, email), testing is simpler — no webhook is needed:

- **Inbound calls** — Activate the agent and call the configured phone number directly
- **Inbound SMS** — Send a text to the configured phone number
- **Inbound email** — Set a test email filter on the channel setup page so the agent only responds to your test email address, then send an email to the connected account

## cURL Example

```bash title="Trigger a test sequence via cURL"
curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "number": "+14155551234",
    "context": "Testing from cURL"
  }'
```

## Debugging Failed Webhooks

If your webhook isn't working:

- Check the webhook URL is correct and includes both `agent_id` and `token` parameters
- Ensure the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`
- Verify `name` and `email` are present in the body
- If the sequence includes calls or SMS, ensure `number` is in E.164 format
- Check the response body for specific error messages
