title: "Webhook Trigger"
description: "Start an outreach sequence from any external system by sending a POST request to your channel's webhook URL."
---

The webhook trigger is how you start an [outreach sequence](/channels/outreach-sequence) from any external system. When a lead is captured — from a form, ad platform, CRM, or automation tool — you send a POST request to your channel's webhook URL to kick off the sequence.

## Getting Your Webhook URL

Each outreach channel has its own unique webhook URL. You'll find it on the channel's setup page under the **Test & Launch** step. The URL includes the agent ID and a secure token:

```text title="Webhook URL format"
https://your-instance.supabase.co/functions/v1/webhook-trigger?agent_id=<agent_id>&token=<webhook_token>
```

<Info>
**Unique per channel:** Each channel has its own webhook URL and token. You can regenerate the token at any time from the channel setup page — this will invalidate the previous URL.
</Info>

## POST Body

Send a JSON payload with the lead's details. The only required fields are `name` and `email`.

```json title="Request body"
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "number": "+14155551234",
  "context": "Submitted enquiry on pricing page",
  "customProperties": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "company": "Acme Corp",
    "plan": "Enterprise"
  }
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Yes | Lead's full name |
| `email` | string | Yes | Lead's email address |
| `number` | string | No | Phone number in E.164 format (e.g., +14155551234). Required if the sequence includes calls or SMS. |
| `context` | string | No | Additional context passed to the AI agent. The agent uses this to personalise conversations. |
| `customProperties` | object | No | Key-value pairs used as template variables in sequence copy (see [Variables](/channels/outreach-sequence#template-variables)). |

## Response

On success, the API returns the scheduled sequence items — showing which channels will fire and when:

```json title="Success response (200)"
{
  "success": true,
  "scheduled": [
    {
      "channel": "call",
      "scheduled_at": "2025-01-15T14:00:00Z",
      "delay_minutes": 0,
      "attempt_number": 1,
      "status": "scheduled"
    },
    {
      "channel": "sms",
      "scheduled_at": "2025-01-15T14:05:00Z",
      "delay_minutes": 5,
      "attempt_number": 2,
      "status": "scheduled"
    },
    {
      "channel": "email",
      "scheduled_at": "2025-01-16T14:00:00Z",
      "delay_minutes": 1440,
      "attempt_number": 3,
      "status": "scheduled"
    }
  ]
}
```
