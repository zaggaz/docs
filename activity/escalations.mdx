When an AI agent encounters a situation it can't handle confidently, it triggers an escalation — flagging the conversation for human review and follow-up.

## What Triggers an Escalation?

After each call, the AI evaluates the conversation and sets a `requires_action` flag if any of the following occurred:

- The call went poorly or the customer raised concerns
- Technical issues occurred during the call
- The customer explicitly requested human follow-up
- Pricing objections were raised that the agent couldn't resolve
- A complex question was asked that falls outside the agent's knowledge base
- The customer was upset or expressed frustration

The AI also provides a `requires_action_reason` — a detailed explanation of what happened and what follow-up is needed.

## How Escalations Appear

Escalated conversations are surfaced in several places:

- **Conversation detail page** — An amber "Action Required" card appears with the AI's reason for escalating. See [Action Required](/activity/conversation-details#action-required).
- **Conversation list** — Threads with the "Awaiting Human Reply" status filter in the [Conversation History](/activity/conversations) page.
- **Notifications** — If you've configured [notifications](/configuration/notifications), escalations trigger alerts via Slack or email so your team is immediately aware.
- **Webhooks** — The `requires_action` and `requires_action_reason` fields are included in [outbound webhook](/configuration/integrations#outbound-webhooks) payloads, allowing external systems to route escalations automatically.

## Resolving Escalations

When you open an escalated conversation, review the AI's reason and the full transcript or message thread. You have two options:

- **Take action** — Send a manual reply (on SMS/WhatsApp), follow up via phone, or update the lead in your CRM. When you send a manual reply, AI responses are automatically disabled for that conversation.
- **Mark as Done** — Click the "Mark as Done" button on the Action Required card to resolve the escalation. This removes it from the pending actions queue.

<Tip>
**Auto-resolve on view:** Escalations are automatically marked as resolved when you open the conversation detail page, since viewing it indicates you're aware of the issue. You can still take further action if needed.

## Structured Data from Calls

After each call, the AI extracts structured data including:

- `requires_action` — Boolean flag indicating escalation
- `requires_action_reason` — Detailed explanation
- `call_went_smoothly` — Whether the call flowed naturally
- Qualification answers and extracted data fields (see [Data Extraction](/data/data-extraction))

This structured data is available on the call detail page, pushed to your CRM, and included in webhook payloads.
