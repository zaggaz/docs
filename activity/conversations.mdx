The conversations page provides a unified view of all agent interactions across every channel — calls, SMS, WhatsApp, and email — in one sortable, filterable list.

## All Threads

Conversations are displayed as threads, each representing a continuous exchange between an agent and a lead on a single channel. The list shows:

- Contact name or number
- Channel icon (call, SMS, WhatsApp, email)
- Message preview or call summary
- Status badge
- Time since last activity

## Channel Tabs

Use the channel tabs at the top to filter by channel type:

- **All** — Every conversation across all channels
- **SMS** — Text message threads only
- **WA** — WhatsApp conversations only
- **Email** — Email threads only
- **Calls** — Voice call records only

## Filtering & Search

Search across conversations by contact name, phone number, or message content. You can also filter by status:

- **Awaiting Human Reply** — The AI has flagged this conversation for human follow-up
- **AI Did Not Respond** — The AI chose not to respond (e.g., spam, opt-out)
- **Responded** — The AI has sent a response
- **Pending** — Awaiting AI processing

For SMS and WhatsApp channels, an additional **AI Status** filter appears, allowing you to see conversations where AI responses have been turned on or off.

## Viewing Conversation Details

Click any thread to open its [conversation detail page](/activity/conversation-details), where you can view full transcripts, message threads, and take actions like sending manual replies.
