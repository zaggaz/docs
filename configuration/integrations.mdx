Connect Unibound to your existing tools — CRMs, calendars, messaging platforms, and custom systems via webhooks. All integrations are managed from the Integrations hub in your dashboard.

## Google Calendar

Connect Google Calendar so your agent can check real-time availability and book meetings. Authorize with your Google account, then select which calendar to use. Configuration options (duration, timezone, lead time) are set per-agent in the [Booking](/agent-setup/booking) step.

## HubSpot

Connect HubSpot to sync conversations and lead data to your CRM. Once connected, Unibound automatically:

- Creates or updates contacts based on lead information
- Logs conversation summaries as notes on the contact record
- Updates lead status and qualification data as custom properties
- Provides calendar booking through HubSpot meeting links

<Tip>
**Field mapping:** Customize how Unibound data maps to HubSpot properties in the integration settings. Default mappings cover name, email, phone, and qualification data.
</Tip>

## Salesforce

Connect Salesforce to log leads and conversation data. Authorize with your Salesforce account and Unibound will sync lead records, conversation summaries, and qualification outcomes to your Salesforce org.

## Slack

Connect Slack to receive notifications when conversations end. Once connected, you can select a channel to post conversation summaries to. Slack is also used for the [Notifications](/configuration/notifications) feature.

## Outbound Webhooks

Send conversation data to any external system by configuring an outbound webhook. Set a URL, choose which event types to subscribe to, and Unibound will POST event data to your endpoint.

### Event Types

- **conversation.ended** — Fired when an AI conversation ends (call, SMS, WhatsApp, or email). Includes conversation details, outcome (meeting booked, opted out), and any extracted data.
- **webhook.received** — Fired when a lead is triggered via your assignment's webhook URL. Includes the lead ID and the raw trigger body.

      "budget": "$50k-$100k",
      "team_size": "6-20"
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
**Extracted data:** The `extracted_data` object contains all fields defined in your [Data Extraction](/data/data-extraction) configuration. Use this to pipe conversation insights into any external system.
</Tip>

### Testing

Use the "Send Test Event" button to deliver a sample `webhook.received` event to your endpoint. This helps verify your webhook URL and event handling before going live. See the [Testing Webhooks](/api-reference/testing-webhooks) guide for more details.

## Connecting & Disconnecting

Each integration uses OAuth for secure authentication. Click "Connect" to start the authorization flow in a popup window. To disconnect, click the integration again. Only organization admins can connect or disconnect integrations.
