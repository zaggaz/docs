Connect email accounts that your AI agents can use to send and receive emails. Currently Gmail is supported, with more providers coming soon.

## Connecting Gmail

Click "Connect Gmail" and authorize Unibound to access your Gmail account via OAuth. Once connected, the email account will be available when creating email agents.

## How It Works

1. Connect your Gmail account using OAuth
2. Your email account becomes available when creating email agents
3. The AI reads incoming emails and responds based on your agent's configuration
4. You can disconnect an account at any time

## Managing Accounts

Connected accounts show their connection status. If an account becomes disconnected (e.g., due to token expiry), you can reconnect it with a single click. Only admins can connect or remove email accounts.

**Permissions:** Only organization admins can connect or disconnect email accounts. Members can view connected accounts but cannot modify them.
