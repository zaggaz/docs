Manage the phone numbers your AI agents use for inbound and outbound calls and SMS. You can purchase numbers directly through Unibound or bring your own Twilio numbers.

## Quick Buy

Purchase a phone number directly through Unibound. Search for available numbers by country (US or UK), number type, area code, or digits you want the number to contain. Once purchased, the number is immediately available for use with your agents.

- **US numbers** — Local or Toll Free
- **UK numbers** — Mobile

## Bring Your Own Number (BYOC)

If you already have a Twilio account, you can import your existing phone numbers. Provide your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and the phone number in E.164 format (e.g., `+14155551234`). Unibound will verify the number has SMS capability before importing it.

<Info>
**Number limits:** Each organization can have one phone number. App admins can have unlimited numbers. Delete your existing number before adding a new one.

## Managing Numbers

- **Labels** — Add a friendly name to identify your numbers
- **Delete** — Remove a number and release it back to Twilio. Default numbers cannot be deleted.

## Assigning to Agents

Once a phone number is added, you can assign it to an agent when setting up an inbound call, outbound call, or SMS channel. Each agent channel needs a phone number to communicate through.
