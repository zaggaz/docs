Get notified when conversations end across all your agents. Notifications can be delivered via email or Slack.

## Email Notifications

Enable email notifications and provide an email address to receive conversation summaries when any agent completes a conversation. Each notification includes the lead details, conversation outcome, and key data extracted during the call.

## Slack Notifications

Post conversation summaries directly to a Slack channel. To use Slack notifications:

1. Connect Slack from the [Integrations](/configuration/integrations) page
2. Enable Slack notifications and select a channel
3. Conversation summaries will be posted to the selected channel automatically

<Info>
**Organization-wide:** Notification settings apply to all agents in your organization. Every completed conversation triggers a notification to the configured channels.

- Lead name and contact information
- Which agent handled the conversation
- Channel used (call, SMS, WhatsApp, email)
- Conversation outcome — whether a meeting was booked
